# **CIS216 WeatherApp**

We will be taking our weather data from openweather.org

We will be taking design inpsiration from weatherbug.com

We only get 60 calls a minute with openweather.org, so we want to call no more than once every minute since openweather updates once every two hours.

## **Standards**:

### *Module Calling Format*
your_module(city=city, country=country, api_key=api_key, other args... ) 

### *Module Documentation*
At the very least, each module should have an 'example_usage' like file which demonstrates and example of the module and its arguments.
If time allows, a short readme should be writen which doccuments module properties and methods in more detail.

### *Module Completion*
If you think you have finished your module, check with another teammate so see if they agree that it is completed and merge it into master, since only work inside master is considered to be done.



## **To-Do List**:

Add to this list of modules, all of the features you want our weather program to have. Anything weather related you want to display, put here.
We can discuss in discord who's going to make each module, and then in this README.md file, just put your name in parentheses next to the module you are making.

### *Smaller Level Modules*
* Map/Radar Module

### *Higher Level Modules*
* Combination/Data Module (Takes all the smaller level modules and combines them to display a list of all the information).
* GUI/Display Module

### *Miscellaneous*
* Static Images

## **Due Dates**:

### *Due By: 10/17*
* ☑ Forecast Module | *Karol*
* ☑ UV Index Module | *Ben*
* ☐ Map/Radar Module | *Ryan*

### *Due By: 10/31*
